\title{Subtree from the Open Tree of Life}
\usage{
tol_induced_subtree(ott_ids = NULL, node_ids = NULL, file, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ott_ids}{Numeric vector. OTT ids indicating nodes to be used 
as tips in the induced tree.}

\item{node_ids}{Character vector. Node ids indicating nodes to be used 
as tips in the induced tree.}

\item{file}{If specified, the function will write the subtree to a
file in newick format.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to customize the API call (see
\code{\link{rotl}} for more information).}
}
\value{
If no value is specified to the \code{file} argument
    (default), a phyogenetic tree of class \code{phylo}.

    Otherwise, the function returns invisibly a logical indicating
    whether the file was successfully created.
}
\description{
Return the induced subtree on the synthetic tree that relates a list of nodes.
}
\details{
Return a tree with tips corresponding to the nodes identified in
the input set that is consistent with the topology of the current
synthetic tree. This tree is equivalent to the minimal subtree
induced on the draft tree by the set of identified nodes.
