# An R interface to Open Tree API

`rotl` is an R package to interact with the Open Tree of Life data APIs. It was
initially developed as part of the
[NESCENT/OpenTree/Arbor hackathon](http://blog.opentreeoflife.org/2014/06/11/apply-for-tree-for-all-a-hackathon-to-access-opentree-resources/).

Client libraries to interact with the Open Tree of Life API also exists for
[Python](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/pyopentree)
and [Ruby](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/bark).


## Installation

The current stable version is available from CRAN, and can be installed by
typing the following at the prompt in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rotl")
```

If you want to test the development version, you first need to install
[ghit](https://github.com/cloudyr/ghit) (`ghit` is a more lightweight version of
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) if your sole purpose is to
install packages that are hosted on GitHub).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ghit")
```

Then you can install `rotl` using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ghit) # or library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/rotl")
```

## Vignettes

There are three vignettes:

- Start by checking out the "How to use `rotl`?" by typing:
  `vignette("how-to-use-rotl", package="rotl")` after installing the
  package.

- Then explore how you can use `rotl` with other packages to combine your data
  with trees from the Open Tree of Life project by typing:
  `vignette("data_mashups", package="rotl")`.

- The vignette "Using the Open Tree Synthesis in a comparative analsysis"
  demonstrates how you can reproduce an analysis of a published paper by
  downloading the tree they used, and data from the supplementary material:
  `vignette("meta-analysis", package="rotl")`.

The vignettes are also available from CRAN:
[How to use `rotl`?](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rotl/vignettes/how-to-use-rotl.html),
[Data mashups](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rotl/vignettes/data_mashups.html),
and
[Using the Open Tree synthesis in a comparative analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rotl/vignettes/meta-analysis.html).

## Quick start

### Get a little bit of the big Open Tree tree

Taxonomic names are represented in the Open Tree by numeric identifiers, the
`ott_ids` (Open Tree Taxonomy identifiers). To extract a portion of a tree from
the Open Tree, you first need to find `ott_ids` for a set of names using the
`tnrs_match_names` function:

```{r resolve}
library(rotl)
apes <- c("Pan", "Pongo", "Pan", "Gorilla", "Hoolock", "Homo")
(resolved_names <- tnrs_match_names(apes))
```

Now we can get the tree with just those tips:

```{r get_tr}
tr <- tol_induced_subtree(ott_ids=resolved_names$ott_id)
plot(tr)
```
